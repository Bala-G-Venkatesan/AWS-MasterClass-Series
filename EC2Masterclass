üñ•Ô∏è EC2 Masterclass - Demo Steps

This repository documents the hands-on demos performed in the EC2 Masterclass video.

üìã Steps Covered

1. Launch an EC2 Instance

   AMI: Amazon Linux 2 (or Ubuntu)
   Instance Type: t2.micro (free tier eligible)
   Create/Use an existing Key Pair
   Configure Security Group:
    Allow SSH (port 22)
    Allow HTTP (port 80)

2. Connect to the Instance via SSH

  chmod 400 your-key.pem
  ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-public-ip

3. Install a Web Server (Apache)

  # For Amazon Linux 2
  sudo yum install httpd -y
  sudo systemctl start httpd
  sudo systemctl enable httpd

 # Create a sample web page
  echo "Welcome to EC2 Masterclass!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
  Access the web server using the Public IP.

4. Modify Security Groups (Demo)

  Revoke port 80 (HTTP) ‚Üí Website becomes inaccessible.
  Allow port 80 again ‚Üí Website becomes accessible.

5. Allocate and Associate an Elastic IP

  Allocate a new Elastic IP.
  Associate the Elastic IP with the EC2 instance.
  Note: Elastic IP remains the same even after stop/start.

6. Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

  Create an AMI (backup) of the running instance.
  Launch a new EC2 instance using this AMI to restore the environment.

7. Terminate the Instance and Cleanup

  Terminate EC2 instance(s).
  Release Elastic IP to avoid unnecessary charges.
  Delete unused AMIs and Snapshots if not needed.

üõë Important Reminders
  Always release unused Elastic IPs to avoid being billed.
